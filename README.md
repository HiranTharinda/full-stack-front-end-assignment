# Full-Stack Developer, Surge Global

## Front-end Assignment

Thanks for taking your time to reading this.

To run this project,

- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm install` inside the project directory .
- Run `npm start`

I've used

- `react.js` and `functional components` with `react hooks`
- `Redux`
- `axios` as the http client
- `styled-components` for styling

I've tried to follow all the instructions given with a bit of creativity. Hope you find this interesting.
